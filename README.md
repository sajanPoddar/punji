Crowdfunding-site by CodeIgniter
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project by raising economic contributions from a huge number of people, typically via the internet.
The crowdfunding model is provided by three types of actors: the project inducer who introduces the idea, groups or individuals
who support the idea and a moderating organization that brings the parties together to lunch the idea. 
But there is no crowdfunding site in Bangladesh. 
Sometimes entrepreneurs canâ€™t proceed with their idea for lack of proper funding.
By building a crowdfunding site an entrepreneur can upload his project to this site to be funded.
Then people, all around the world can see that project and if they are convinced, they can fund for that project.
Those who will fund, will be given privileges or returns which is offered by the project inducer.
This site can also be useful for general people suffering from acute diseases or other problems. 
Users can donate money for them to fund their treatment and this way a huge amount of donation can be collected in a short time. 
This way, the site gains a social value.
