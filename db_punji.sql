No more worrying about every small knock to your expensive but fragile helmet.</span></li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <span ><strong>ONE SIZE THAT FITS ALL</strong> - the flexibility &amp; patented adjustment system give the Headkayse unprecedented ability to fit any size of head, from children to large adults. It even quickly adapts to woolly hats!</span></li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <span ><strong>AMAZING COMFORT</strong> - Whatever shape your head is (we&#39;re all different!) Headkayse will adjust &amp; mould to your head, quickly feeling incredibly comfy and secure.</span></li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <span ><strong>CUTTING EDGE STYLING</strong> - Carefully crafted to blend the best helmet shapes that suit the human head - Headkayse looks surprisingly good on all people. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>\r\n Why do I need a flexible Helmet?</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n <span >Headkayse embraces individuality. Because of its flexibility, and our patented adjustment system, the helmet simply just adapts to your head shape, making it more comfortable, fit more securely and&nbsp;look more compact.&nbsp; For the first time since the days of leather helmets in the 1930&rsquo;s, a cycle helmet conforms to your head shape. And it&#39;s truly one size fits ALL, need we say more?</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n <span >OK nothing personal but let&#39;s be honest, cycle helmets are pretty strange looking things on most people. Aerodynamic wedges for roadies are great if you&#39;re in the Tour de France, but a bit weird when yoou&#39;re just poppping to the shops.

Part of the needed material was either already bought with our own efforts, hired from Angela&#39;s university or kindly lent by friends.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n We&#39;re now at a point where we need to supplement funds, mostly for the shoot. Here&#39;s the breakdown:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n <span  0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;">The Impact</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n Thirty years ago, the exquisite Lear&rsquo;s Macaw was on the brink of extinction - there were only 70 known birds left in the wild. Since then, amazing work has been carried out by Biodiversitas along with local people and researchers such as Erica. Working together to help conserve the species, they&rsquo;ve achieved astonishing results: numbers have increased from a few dozen in the late 1980s to about 1300 today.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n In October 2016, when &#39;To Catch a Macaw&#39; is completed, it will be screened at the BBC headquarters in Bristol, UK. The plan is to then enter the documentary into conservation film festivals around the world so we can share this success story far and wide. Also, in order to reach the local people living in close proximity to these amazing birds, a future campaign will advocate for a screening in Canudos, Brazil.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n Our biggest expenses will be:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   getting both crew members on location;</p>\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   paying for equipment insurance;</p>\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  <p>\r\n   arranging other much needed equipment such as solar panels and a small generator.</p>\r\n </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n Overloading the responsibilities of production management, camerawork and sound recording onto one person would affect the potential quality of the film. To avoid this risk, it&#39;s important that C&eacute;sar and Angela work as a team.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n Bringing cameras, lenses, gadgets and computers on location always involves risks of theft and damage. Although we take great precautions to ensure the safety of our equipment, we can&#39;t go without insurance for it all. Unfortunately, this will take a large chunk of our budget.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n Since we&#39;ll be camping and shooting in a remote location, there will be no electricity to charge our equipment. A few items can be charged in the vehicle, but to guarantee that our entire kit is fully powered and ready to shoot on schedule we&#39;ll need solar panels and a small generator. Just imagine how AMAZING it would be to power our documentary shoot entirely on a renewable energy resource!!!
